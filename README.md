# Convex Optimization Course Project (Optimal Transport)
This is our team project for *Convex Optimization* (2018 Fall PKU) by Dinghuai Zhang and Weijie Chen.
This is the [course site](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/opt-2018-fall.html).

Our project focus on discussion and implementation of several numerical algorithms for solving discrete optimal transport problem. The midterm report is placed in the `midterm` folder, while the final codes and report files are in `FinalCodes` and `FinalReports` folder, respectively.

Also, part of the homework for this class is upload and is placed in `homework`. It's about different ways to solve a lasso problem. Details can be seen in `homework/homework5.pdf`.
